Please provide the following information to make it easier for the developer to understand:
- What userscript manager are you using?
- What browser and browser version are you using?
- What is the full url that is causing the issue? (the entire url where the issue occurs)

> [!CAUTION]
> Please try these fixes before making an issue.
- Go to your userscript manager's extension settings in your browser, and try checking the box "Allow access to file URLs".

If this doesn't work, go ahead and make the issue.
